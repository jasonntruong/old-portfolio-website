                <img id=headshot src=headshot.png>
                <p>I'm Jason Truong, a Vietnamese second year computer science student at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada.</br></br>

                    My interest in computer science sparked at a young age. In grade 4 I was hooked on coding flash games and objects into Roblox...but with little success.</br></br>

                    My obsession would lay dormant until I took a computer science course in grade 11. This would soon rekindle my childhood fascination, and for the first time, I was enjoying school!</br></br>

                    Fast forward to today, if all goes well, I'll be graduating with a BSc. Hons degree in Computer Science in 2025 as I'm enrolled in a 5 year coop program.

                <p><strong>Code Sensei at Code Ninjas</strong></br></br>
                    At Code Ninjas, my role as a Code Sensei is to teach the students how to code!<br><br>

                    Using Java, JavaScript, Lua, and Scratch, I am able to organize 1-3 hour lessons to train their programming logic and show them how to "think like a computer" - rather than the coding syntax. <br><br>

                    Since the ninjas are in elementary school, I am also responsible for keeping them engaged, focused, and answering their coding queries in the most simplest way possible. <br><br><br>

                    <strong>Online Freelance Tutor</strong></br></br>

                    At the start of the school year and prior to becoming a Code Sensei, I decided to start online tutoring since I did not work during the Summer due to covid. </br></br>

                    I tutor elementary school students via Zoom. My responsibilities include helping my students with their homework, re-explaining key concepts from class, assigning homework for practice, and answering questions via email off hours. </br></br>

                    Ultimately, since starting in September 2020, I have been responsible for the academic success of my students.

                <p><strong>Ryerson's Computer Science Course Union</strong></br></br>
                    The <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryersoncscu target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>Ryerson CSCU</a> is a group of elected students that aim to provide computer science students with the best opportunities and experience.</br></br>

                    Currently, as VP Communications, I am the public relations contact for the CSCU. I also design and promote all of our events via our <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryersoncscu/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>Instagram,</a> <a href=https://twitter.com/ryecscu target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>Twitter,</a> <a href=https://www.facebook.com/ryecscu target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>Facebook,</a> <a href=https://ryecscu.com/ target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link> website,</a> by contacting other student socities, and through our monthly newsletter distributed to all CS students at Ryerson!</br></br></br>

                    In my first year, as the <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFsocoZB5t2 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>Deputy of VP Operations</a>, I perform tasks that range from planning events/workshops to advocating the concerns of CS students to the CS department heads.</br></br>
                    
                    The CSCU also collaborates with student groups to further provide students with larger scale workshops. One example was an event where I, on behalf of the CSCU, collaborated with <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryerson_wics target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>WiCS (Women in CS)</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/lug_ryerson target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>LUG (Linux User Group)</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryersondsc target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>DSC (Developer Student Club)</a>, and Guelph and McMaster University to host <strong>"Technical Interview Day"</strong></br></br>
                    
                    At this event, we invited 5 ex-FAANG Ryerson, Guelph, and McMaster students to talk about the interview process and the tips and tricks to ace the Technical Interview!</br></br>

                <p>My number one interest is creating. </br></br>

                    Creating is an ambiguous term but what I mean from that is: </br></br>
                    
                    I love to create videos, art, apps, programs/code, keyboards, food, Arduino projects, and most importantly, travelling memories.</br></br>

                    Aside from this, I also spend a lot of time watching anime :D
