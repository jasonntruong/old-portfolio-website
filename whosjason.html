                    <h1>Who Am I</h1>
                    <img id=headshot src=headshot.jpg>
                    <p>I'm Jason Truong, a Vietnamese first year computer science student at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada.</br></br>

                        My interest in computer science sparked at a young age. In grade 4 I was hooked on coding flash games and objects into Roblox...but with little success</br></br>

                        My obsession would lay dormant until I took a computer science course in grade 11. This would soon re-kindle my childhood fascination, and for the first time, I was enjoying school!</br></br>

                        Fast forward to today, if all goes well, I'll be graduating with a BSc. Hons degree in Computer Science in 2025 as I'm enrolled in a 5 year coop program.

                    </p>

                        The <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CLcGPO2hCPV target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryerson CSCU</a> is a group of elected students that aim to provide computer science students with the best opportunities and experience.</br></br>

                        As the <a href=https://www.instagram.com/p/CFsocoZB5t2 target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">Deputy of VP Operations</a>, I perform tasks that range from planning events/workshops to voicing the concerns of CS students to the CS department heads</br></br>
                        
                        The CSCU also collaborates with student groups to further provide students with larger scale workshops. One example was an event where I, on behalf of the CSCU, collaborated with <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryerson_wics target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">wiCS (Women in CS)</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/lug_ryerson target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">LUG (Linux User Group)</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryersondsc target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">DSC (Developer Student Club)</a>, and Guelph and McMaster University to host <strong>"Technical Interview Day"</strong></br></br>
                        
                        At this event, we invited 5 ex-FAANG Ryerson, Guelph, and McMaster students to talk about the interview process and the tips and tricks to acing the Technical Interview!</br></br>

                        <strong>Online Freelance Tutor</strong></br></br>

                        At the start of the school year, I decided to start online tutoring since I did not work during the Summer due to covid. </br></br>

                        I tutor elementary school students via Zoom. My responsibilites include helping my students with their homework, re-explaining key concepts from class, assigning homework for practice, and answering questions via email off hours. </br></br>

                        Ultimately, since starting in September 2020, I have been responsible for the academic success of my students. :D

                    <p>My number one interests is creating. </br></br>

                        Creating is an ambigious term but what I mean from that is: </br></br>
                        
                        I love to create things like videos, art, programs/code, keyboards, food, and most importantly, travelling memories.
