                    <h1>Who Am I</h1>
                    <p>I'm Jason Truong, a first year computer science student at Ryerson University in Toronto, Canada.</br></br>
                        
                        I became interested in computer science from a young age. In grade 4 I was hooked on flash games and coding objects into Roblox...but with little success</br></br>

                        This attraction would lay dormant until grade 11 when I took a computer science course. This would unlock my childhood fascination, and for the first time, I was enjoying school!</br></br>

                        Now, if all goes well, I'll be graduating with a BSc. Hons degree in Computer Science in 2025 as I'm enrolled in a 5 year coop program.

                    <p><strong>Ryerson's Computer Science Course Union</strong></br></br>
                        The Ryerson CSCU is a group of elected students that aim to provide computer science students with the best opportunities and experience.</br></br>

                        As the Deputy of VP Operations, I perform tasks that range from planning events/workshops to voicing the concerns of CS students to the CS department heads</br></br>
                        
                        The CSCU also collaborates with student groups to further provide students with larger scale workshops. One example was an event where I, on behalf of the CSCU, collaborated with <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryerson_wics target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">wiCS (Women in CS)</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/lug_ryerson target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">LUG (Linux User Group)</a>, <a href=https://www.instagram.com/ryersondsc target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer">DSC (Developer Student Club)</a>, and Guelph and McMaster University to host <strong>"Technical Interview Day"</strong></br></br>
                        
                        At this event, we invited 5 ex-FAANG Ryerson, Guelph, and McMaster students to talk about the interview process and the tips and tricks to acing the Technical Interview!</br></br>
