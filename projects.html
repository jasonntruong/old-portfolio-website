                    <p><a href=https://devpost.com/software/cov-id-6axy9o target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" id=link>Awarded Best Hardware Hack Sponsored by Digi-key at yuHacks 2021 (York University)</a></br></br>
                        cov-ID is an NFC card and app duo. There are 2 sides to the app; the user side and service side.</br></br>
                        The user side allows everyone with a cov-ID card to see their recent test information (test result, test date, test location) and where they have scanned their cov-ID.</br></br>
                        The service side will be the people who scan the cov-ID, i.e restaurants scanning customer's cov-ID. With the app, they can scan and get the previously listed information from their customers or set restrictions on who's allowed in: i.e refusing those who do not take the vaccine, those that haven't been tested in x amount of days, and those who were recently tested positive but refusing to quarantine.</br></br>
                        This ultimately makes businesses and public places more safe and also people more comfortable to go outside as they can go to businesses whose restrictions they agree with.</br></br>
                        <strong>cov-ID was built with NFC technology, Google Cloud's Google Maps API, Java, XML, and Android Studio!</strong>

                        Lucid aims to make life easier for the blind.</br></br>
                        It's an app whose main function is to use the phone's camera and text-to-speech to tell the user what objects are in front of them (object recognition) or what the text in front of them says (text recognition). Ex: Grocery shopping, blind people can't tell if an apple is red or green!</br></br>
                        We also have incredible UI features built in like physical/tactile feedback on button clicks, text-to-speech to describe the activity that appears on the screen, voice command startup, speech speed customization, and many other features so that Lucid is perfectly curated for users without sight.</br></br>
                        <strong>Lucid was built with Google Cloud's Vision API, Machine Learning Kit, Java, XML, and Android Studio!</strong>

                    <p>An online game I am still building with the goal of self-teaching myself <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js</strong></br></br>
                        In Fill the Lyric, players are given an embedded YouTube music video and a line of lyrics - but with a catch!</br></br>
                        There is a missing word from the prompted lyrics and the player is responsible for filling it in!</br></br>
                        Play solo or play with your friends in custom lobbys and race to "Fill the Lyric"!
